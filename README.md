# Ubuntu Terminal Tutorial

A modified version of the [Ubuntu Terminal](https://github.com/cjativa/Ubuntu-Terminal) repository I created. This is a shorter, less capable version of the original Ubuntu Terminal as this is for *tutorial* purposes only.

Meant to help others create and style their own terminals for the browser here [Creating an Ubuntu Terminal](http://zerochass.io/tutorial/creating-an-ubuntu-terminal-with-react).

See the deployed version here [Ubuntu Terminal - Tutorial](https://ubuntu-tutorial.stackblitz.io).
